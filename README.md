### We can configure aws and arrange the parts in the private-console.ts file under the bin file according to our own configurations.
### 
```bash
let region:string= ""; #The region where the cdk will be deployed must contain regions supported by AWS manage private console access. AWS DOC: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/console-private-access.html
let CompanyName:string= "";   
let whichEnv:string= "";
let accountid:string="";


const vpcTest = new network.VPC(app, 'VPC', {
    company: CompanyName,
    cidr: '10.120.0.0/16', #VPC cidr to use
    whichEnv: whichEnv,
    zone:1,
    gateway:1
});

### PrivateAccess-policy must be attached after the cdk is deployed on users to restrict public access.
